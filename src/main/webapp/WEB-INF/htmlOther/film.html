    Matko is a small time hustler, living by the river Danube with his 17 year old son Zare.
    After a failed business deal he owes money to the much more successful gangster
    Dadan. Dadan has a sister, Afrodita, that he desperately wants to see get married so
    they strike a deal: Zare is to marry her. But none of the two care much for an arranged
    marriage: Zare is in love with Ida, Afrodita is waiting for the man of her dreams.
